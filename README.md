# sqlalchemy-challenge
sql flask + python API activity

Since I'm headed to Honolulu Hawaii this database is intended to do a climate analysis about the area.

**#Part1: Analyse and Explore the Data**

In this section, I used Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of your climate database. All code is stored in the climate_analysis.ipynb file.


**#Part2: Climate app design**

In this section I designed a Flask API based on the queries that I developed. Find app.py in the folder to launch the app.
